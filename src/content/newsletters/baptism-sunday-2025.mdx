# A Day of Celebration

What an incredible Sunday we had! The atmosphere was charged with expectancy as we gathered to witness **25 precious souls** take the step of water baptism.

Baptism is an outward sign of an inward grace. It is a public declaration that "I have decided to follow Jesus; no turning back, no turning back."

## The Message

Before we headed to the pool, we shared a brief word from **Romans 6:4**:

> "We were therefore buried with him through baptism into death in order that, just as Christ was raised from the dead through the glory of the Father, we too may live a new life."

We were reminded that the water isn't magic, but the *obedience* is powerful. Going under the water symbolizes the burial of the old self, and coming up symbolizes the resurrection into a new life with Christ.

## Testimonies

One of the highlights was hearing from **Sarah**, who shared:

> "I've been coming to church for years, but I always felt like I was on the outside looking in. Today, stepping into that water, I felt a weight lift off my shoulders. I am fully His."

## What's Next?

For those who were baptized, the journey has just begun. We encourage you to:

1.  **Join the New Believers Class** starting next Wednesday.
2.  **Get connected** in a Life Group.
3.  **Keep reading** the Gospel of John this month.
