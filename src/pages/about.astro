        <h2>Our Mission</h2>
        <p>
          At Liberty Christian Center, our mission is to proclaim the Lord's Favour, Nurture and release ministries to the nations. We are dedicated to fostering a vibrant community where faith is nurtured, lives are enriched, and the love of God is demonstrated through service and outreach.
        </p>

        <h2 class="mt-6">Our Vision</h2>
        <p>
          We envision a church deeply rooted in biblical truth, passionately committed to worship, and actively engaged in making a positive impact on our local and global communities. We strive to be a beacon of hope, leading people to discover their purpose in Christ and equipping them to fulfill their God-given potential.
        </p>

        <h2 class="mt-6">What We Believe</h2>
        <p>
          We believe in one God, eternally existing in three persons: Father, Son, and Holy Spirit. We believe the Bible is the inspired, infallible, and authoritative Word of God. We believe in the deity of our Lord Jesus Christ, His virgin birth, His sinless life, His miracles, His vicarious and atoning death, His bodily resurrection, His ascension to the right hand of the Father, and His personal return in power and glory.
        </p>
        <p class="mt-4">
          We also believe in the spiritual unity of believers in our Lord Jesus Christ, and in the present ministry of the Holy Spirit, by whose indwelling the Christian is enabled to live a godly life.
        </p>

        <h2 class="mt-6">Join Our Community</h2>
        <p>
          Whether you're new to faith, seeking a church home, or simply exploring, we invite you to join us. We offer a variety of ministries and services designed for all ages and stages of life. Come and experience faith, fellowship, and family at Liberty Christian Center.
